Welcome to **Y lab**!

This is the very first post on the new Hugo static site, powered by the beautiful Blowfish theme. 

## What to Expect
This blog will explore my thoughts on:
*   **Artificial Intelligence:** Deep dives into new models, capabilities, and ethical implications.
*   **Engineering:** Best practices, architecture, and coding adventures.
*   **Everything in between:** Occasional musings on tech and productivity.

Stay tuned for more updates!
